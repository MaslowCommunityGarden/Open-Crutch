# Open Crutch

An open source CNC cut crutch which can be resized to be right for the person using it


This crutch was designed by one of our kickstarter backers who is a nurse named Jessica. She chose to make it open source so that anyone could have easy access to crutches. What an amazing thing to give to the world!

Here's a picture of the crutch in our shop:
